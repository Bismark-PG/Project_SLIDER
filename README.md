At its core, Project : SLIDER is a high-speed parkour game that emphasizes rapid movement and jumping. However, each stage features unique gimmicks and obstacles designed to block your path.

To succeed, you must master two key mechanics
1. **Strategic Sliding:** Sliding drastically increases your speed but limits your steering. You must strategically mix running and sliding to maintain momentum while navigating tight corners.
2. **Interactive Shooting:** Use your **Laser Gun** to interact with the environment. You will need to destroy walls or hit switches to open locked paths and proceed to the goal.

The game features immersive level design to keep you on your toes, along with user-friendly options like **Mouse Sensitivity** adjustment to ensure the best gameplay experience for every player.

**Have Fun!**
